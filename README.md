# leaflet-challenge

## Background

Use leaflet library from Javascript to create a map that shows earthquakes from the past 7 days using earthquake geojson data from the United States Geological Survey.

The map shows all earthquakes from the past 7 days. The data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and darker in color. A legend is available to provide additional context for the map data. Clicking a marker opens a popup that includes the location, magnitude, and date for the earthquake that was clicked.

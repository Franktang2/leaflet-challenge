# leaflet-challenge

## Background

This repository includes a map visualization showing earthquakes from the past 7 days using earthquake geojson data from the United States Geological Survey. The map was built using the Leaflet JavaScript library.

This map shows all earthquakes from the past 7 days. The data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and darker in color. A legend is available to provide additional context for the map data. Clicking a marker opens a popup that includes the location, magnitude, and date for the earthquate that was clicked.
